Most of the electrical work occurred in the design phase in MTE 481 last fall. So, all that remains is to connect the components (everything will be soldered together). With luck, everything will work perfectly after being connected, so there will not be too many electrical updates. All components which must be physically connected are shown in the schematic below.

Since we are working remotely, I will complete all of the work involving the electrical components of our system. A brief overview of what I aim to accomplish is:
Solder the appropriate resistor to some wires and to the visual indicator LED (the LED which lights up to signal the pedestrian is detected. Sizing of the wires will be completed when we put all the components into the enclosure.
Repeat the previous step, but for the audio indicator (buzzer)
The wires which will go from the electrical enclosure to the tactile pad to connect to the force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are bundled in one protective casing. This must be appropriately stripped such that pairs of wires can reach each corner of the tactile pad. Since it is large, this will be up to ~3 feet. 
Since we have yet to receive the FSRs, I will follow up with Digikey to inquire about the order status.
