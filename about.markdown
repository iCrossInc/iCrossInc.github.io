Hello and welcome to our FYDP website. We have named our group iCross, since our group aims to create a system which can automatically detect pedestrians (utilizing vision and weight detection). 

This project was motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the sudden aversion of the public to frequently-touched surfaces. Additionally, when brainstorming project ideas we had to take into consideration the government restrictions and chose a project which we could effectively work on remotely.

Our group consists of three members: Sean, Taylor and Thomas. Sean has extensive work experience in software development and has taken on the role of the teams Software Lead. Taylor also has extensive experience in software development, but she is also quite capable in mechanical design and as such has acquired the role of Mechanical Lead. Thomas has worked in several blended electrical/mechanical engineering positions, so he has taken over the position of Electrical Lead. A photo of the team is included below.
